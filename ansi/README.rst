ANSI
====

Welcome to the C++ ANSI Colour library, designed to make it easier to use ANSI in your code.

One special feature that this has is the ability to make your own **custom colours**. 

.. code-block:: cpp
    #include <ansi.h>
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
    }
